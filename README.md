# theBattleforZagorsk
 
# This is an arma campaign I am running
These missions are intended to be self-ran and not require a zeus<br>
however, the squad lead will be promoted to game master incase issues arise.<br>

this campaign follows the invasion of a small country by a corrupt army general attempting to claim territory and land for himself before the collapse of the union<br>
